## Synopsis

Automatic webguide alignment embedded system using an AVR microcontroller and HD447880 LCD for user interface and step-motor as actuator.
During the processing of a laminate often it happens that the material displaced from the correct stroke, causing printing desaligments or incorrect winding of the tape.
The system enables to continously track of the alignment of the material and make fast corrections.


## Features 

The system automatically search for the center of the table. 
Manual mode enables user corrections while automatic mode the corrections are made automatically using displacement sensor.
User parameter: 3 corrections zones (hysteresis, slow, fast), motor speed (RPM), inverted sensor mode, the number of sensors fails(avoids immediately corrections).
